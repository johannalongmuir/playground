    When given a method with two arguments, the second is a comma separated list. The first is a whole word.
    If the second contains words that make up the "whole word" then each word is split.
    For example:
    “Baseball”, “a,all,b,ball,bas,base,cat,code,d,e,quit,z”
    Should return “base,ball”
