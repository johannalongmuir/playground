    /*
    The input for this problem will be an array of numbers representing a set, which only contains unique numbers,
    and your goal is to print every possible set combination, otherwise known as the power set. For example:
    input set = [1, 2, 3]
    power set = [[], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3] [1, 2, 3]] 

    Example:powerSet([1, 2, 3]) -> [[], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3] [1, 2, 3]]
